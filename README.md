# ANCHOR Demo

This repository is a **demo, playground, and attacker validation environment** for the **ANCHOR** secure transport protocol.

ANCHOR itself lives in a separate repository and is designed as a reusable infrastructure component.  
This repo exists to:

- demonstrate how to embed ANCHOR in real applications
- provide a runnable CLI demo (client/server)
- host active MITM and attack scripts
- validate security claims empirically

## What this repo is
- A reference consumer of ANCHOR
- A security testing and threat-modeling playground
- A place to experiment with UX and tooling

## What this repo is not
- The protocol implementation
- A production-ready application
- A replacement for TLS

For protocol details, see the **ANCHOR** repository.
